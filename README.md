# Kronk

This project lets you use Go for hardware accelerated local inference with llama.cpp directly integrated into your applications via the [yzma](https://github.com/hybridgroup/yzma) module. Kronk provides a high-level API that feels similar to using an OpenAI compatible API.

This project also provides a model server for chat completions and embeddings. The server is compatible with the OpebWebUI project.

Here is the current [catalog](https://github.com/ardanlabs/kronk_catalogs) of models that have been verified to work with Kronk.

## Roadmap

Here is the existing [ROADMAP](ROADMAP.md) for the project and the things being worked on or things that would be nice to have. The roadmap is not in any particular order.

If you are interested in helping in any way, please send an email to [Bill Kennedy](mailto:bill@ardanlabs.com).

## Features

Here is the existing [FEATURES](FEATURES.md) list for the project. The features are not in any particular order.

## Architecture

The architecture of Kronk is designed to be simple and scalable. The Kronk API allows you to write applications that can diectly interact with local open source GGUF models (supported by llama.cpp) that provide inference for text and media (vision and audio).

Check out the [examples](#examples) section below.

If you want an OpenAI compatible model server, the Kronk model server leverages the power of the Kronk API to give you a concurrent and scalable web api.

Run `make kronk-server` to check it out.

The diagram below shows how the Kronk model server supports access to multiple models. The model server manages kronk API instances that each provide access to a model. The Kronk API allows concurrent access to the models in a safe and reliable way.

```
                   -> Kronk API -> Yzma -> Llama.cpp -> Model 1 (1 instance)
Client -> Kronk MS -> Kronk API -> Yzma -> Llama.cpp -> Model 2 (1 instance)
                   -> Kronk API -> Yzma -> Llama.cpp -> Model 3 (1 instance)
```

You can configure the number of Models that stay loaded in memory (default: 3) through configuration how long they will stay in memory (default: 5m) when not being used. This allows you to manage the resouces on the hardware.

For more details on the settings, run the following command after installing Kronk:

```shell
kronk server --help
```

## Models

Kronk uses models in the GGUF format supported by llama.cpp. You can find many models in GGUF format on Hugging Face (over 147k at last count):

https://huggingface.co/models?library=gguf&sort=trending

## Support

Kronk currently has support for over 94% of llama.cpp functionality thanks to yzma. See the yzma [ROADMAP.md](https://github.com/hybridgroup/yzma/blob/main/ROADMAP.md) for the complete list.

You can use multimodal models (image/audio) and text language models with full hardware acceleration on Linux, on macOS, and on Windows.

| OS      | CPU          | GPU                             |
| ------- | ------------ | ------------------------------- |
| Linux   | amd64, arm64 | CUDA, Vulkan, HIP, ROCm, SYCL   |
| macOS   | arm64        | Metal                           |
| Windows | amd64        | CUDA, Vulkan, HIP, SYCL, OpenCL |

Whenever there is a new release of llama.cpp, the tests for yzma are run automatically. Kronk runs tests once a day and will check for updates to llama.cpp. This helps us stay up to date with the latest code and models.

## API Examples

There are examples in the examples direction:

_The first time you run these programs the system will download and install the model and libraries._

[AUDIO](examples/audio/main.go) - This example shows you how to execute a simple prompt against an audio model.

```shell
make example-audio
```

[CHAT](examples/chat/main.go) - This example shows you how to create a simple chat application against an inference model using kronk. Thanks to Kronk and yzma, reasoning and tool calling is enabled.

```shell
make example-chat
```

[EMBEDDING](examples/embedding/main.go) - This example shows you how to use an embedding model.

```shell
make example-embedding
```

[QUESTION](examples/question/main.go) - This example shows you a basic program of using Kronk to ask a model a question.

```shell
make example-question
```

[VISION](examples/vision/main.go) - This example shows you how to execute a simple prompt against a vision model.

```shell
make example-vision
```

[WEB](examples/web/main.go) - This example shows you a web service that provides a chat endpoint for asking questions to a model with a browser based chat UI.

```shell
make example-web
```

You can find more examples in the ArdanLabs AI training repo at [Example13](https://github.com/ardanlabs/ai-training/tree/main/cmd/examples/example13).

## Kronk Model Server

The model server is OpenAI compatible and you can use OpenWebUI to interact with it. To start the Kronk model server run:

```shell
kronk server
```

You will need to load a model if this is the first time you're using the system. To download a starter model run the catalog list command to see the current catalog of models:

```shell
kronk catalog list --local

CATALOG              MODEL ID
Audio-Text-to-Text   Qwen2-Audio-7B.Q8_0
Embedding            embeddinggemma-300m-qat-Q8_0
Image-Text-to-Text   Qwen2.5-VL-3B-Instruct-Q8_0
Text-Generation      gpt-oss-20b-Q8_0
Text-Generation      Qwen3-8B-Q8_0
```

Then download the `Qwen3-8B-Q8_0` model using the catalog pull command:

```shell
kronk catalog pull Qwen3-8B-Q8_0 --local
```

If you want to play with OpenWebUI, run the following commands:

```shell
make install-owu
make owu-up
```

The open your browser to `localhost:8081` or open another terminal window and run:

```shell
make owu-browse
```

QUESTION: Hello model

Okay, the user said "Hello model." I need to respond appropriately. First, I should acknowledge their greeting. Since they mentioned "model," maybe they're referring to me as a language model. I should clarify that I'm Qwen, a large language model developed by Alibaba Cloud. I should keep the response friendly and open-ended, inviting them to ask questions or share topics they're interested in. Let me make sure the tone is welcoming and helpful. Also, check for any possible misunderstandings. They might be testing if I recognize the term "model," so confirming my identity as Qwen is important. Alright, time to put it all together in a natural, conversational way.

! I'm Qwen, a large language model developed by Alibaba Cloud. How can I assist you today? 😊 Whether you have questions, need help with something, or just want to chat, feel free to let me know!
